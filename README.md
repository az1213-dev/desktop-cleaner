A fast, lightweight terminal file organizer. It cleans up cluttered folders (like your Downloads or Desktop), sorts files into organized directories by type, lets you preview changes before touching anything, and keeps a dedicated log of every run so you can undo changes with a single command.

Written in pure Python with standard library modules, so you can run it immediately without installing any third-party packages.

- **Zero-Dependency CLI**: Runs directly in Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell, macOS Terminal, or Linux using standard Python.
- **Dedicated Run Logs**: Every organization run creates its own log file (`run_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<id>.log`) recording the exact before and after paths for every file moved.
- **1-Click Undo**: Revert any previous run instantly via `clutterctrl undo <Run ID>` or through the interactive menu.
- **Dry Run Previews**: Check file lists, categories, destination paths, and sizes in a clean table before anything gets moved.
- **Background Folder Watcher**: Optionally watch folders like Downloads to auto-sort new files as they arrive, with built-in debounce so it never touches partial downloads.
- **Standard and Deep Scans**: Choose between organizing top-level files or scanning entire folder trees recursively while cleaning up empty folders.
- **Safe Renaming**: Never overwrites existing files. If a file with the same name exists, it automatically adds a counter (like `photo_1.png`).
- **Stats & History**: View your past runs and see a visual bar chart of how your storage is organized across categories.

### Supported Categories

**Images** · **Videos** · **Audio** · **Documents** · **Code & Web** · **Projects & Creative** · **Data & Databases** · **Archives** · **Executables** · **Fonts** · **Misc**

ClutterCtrl creates a dedicated log file for every run inside the repository:
- **Log Path**: `clutterctrl/logs/run_*.log`

### What a Run Log Looks Like
```text
Run ID: run_2026-08-31_13-52-17_aad725
Run started: 2026-08-31T13:52:17.123456
Target: C:\Users\Username\Downloads
Deep Scan: False
Mode: clean
Status: ACTIVE

--- OPERATIONS ---
MOVED: C:\Users\Username\Downloads\photo.png -> C:\Users\Username\Downloads\Images\photo.png | Category: Images | Size: 1048576
MOVED: C:\Users\Username\Downloads\report.pdf -> C:\Users\Username\Downloads\Documents\report.pdf | Category: Documents | Size: 524288

--- SUMMARY ---
Total files moved: 2
Images: 1
Documents: 1
Total bytes: 1572864
Run completed: 2026-08-31T13:52:17.456789

When you undo a run, ClutterCtrl reads the operations in reverse, puts all files back in their original folders, and marks the log as `UNDONE`.
